## 0.1_beta(2022-11-11)

In the beta releases (<1.0) we log only the main differences with respect to the latest public release of the code, SimProp-v2r4, available [here](https://augeraq.sites.lngs.infn.it/SimProp/)

- Continuous losses: Add EBL in the pair production loss length
- Continuous losses: Compute the pair production loss length for an arbitrary photon field from [Chodorowski et al., ApJ, 1992](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJ...400..181C/abstract)
- Continuous losses: Implement pion-production continuous energy losses for plots following [HÃ¼mmer et al., ApJ, 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:1002.1310)
- Stochastic interactions: Improve sampling of the background photon energy for an arbitrary photon field
